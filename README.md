### Summary :-
In this noetbook, CNN architecture and transfer learning techniques will be used to classify cats and dogs in the Cats & Dogs dataset.Firstly, the sub dataset is loaded into the notebook (why not full dataset because I trained this CNN architecture in local CPU) Then evaluated with downloaded Images <br>

Transfer learning is one of the important advantages of deep learning.In this InceptionV3 is used <br>
